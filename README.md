While reading big pdfs book, I was too tired to read it, so wrote one simple python script which can read my book for me

I mostly work on linux, so, there is this glitch with okular and foxit, there reading option was not working, so I manually made this script which will ready any pdf file!

First, we need to install a python libaries, use these commands

### Installation 

To Read pdf files using python

` pip install pypdf2  
`

To Read text (text to speech) 

` pip install pyaudio 
`

` pip install pyttsx3 
`

### Lastly

To use it, download .py file and run it using 
` python3 file.py
`
