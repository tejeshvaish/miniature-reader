# miniature-reader
While reading big pdfs book, I was too tired to read it, so wrote one simple python script which can read my book for me

I mostly work on linux, so, there is this glitch with okular and foxit, there reading option was not working, so I manually made this script which will ready any pdf file!

First, we need to install a python libaries, use these commands
pip install pypdf2  
pip install pyaudio
pip install pyttsx3
